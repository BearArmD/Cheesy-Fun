it was a cheesy fun way to learn some visual and audio scripting elements... funny story, the project began as a learning project for python, which quickly became JS, eventually landing on 100% html XD thats life...
i am now working with unity to better learn C#! making a cheesy 2D game!
keep learning, and always stay rockin'! XD
